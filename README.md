# Password-Strength-Checker
### 🔐 Password Strength Checker  

This project is a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on:  
Length of the password  
🔹 Use of lowercase &amp; uppercase letters  
🔹 Inclusion of numbers  
🔹 Use of special characters

The project helps to check whether a password is Weak, Fair, Good, Strong, or Very Strong, making it useful for learning about basic cybersecurity and password hygiene.

##  How It Works 

The user inputs a password.

The script uses regex patterns to analyze different password criteria.

A strength score is calculated, and a friendly emoji-based rating is displayed.

##  Run
python password_checker.py


# Input:

Enter your password: Hello@123


# Output:

Password Strength: Strong 💪

##  Use Cases

Beginner-friendly Python & regex practice

A base project for extending into GUI apps or web tools
